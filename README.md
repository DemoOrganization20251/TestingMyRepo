Overview
In the rapidly shifting landscape of Web3, maintaining proactive and responsive security infrastructure is essential. Magnus bridges the gap between manual SecOps and the demand for rea are exploited, automate incident response procedures, and maintain visibility across all deployed smart contracts. It is designed to act not just as a monitoring system, but as a decision-making engine that integrates with both human and machine agents.

Key Capabilities
Security Orchestration: Centralize your security tools, data, and workflows into one coordinated system.

Modular Automation: Deploy AI agents and pre-built automations tailored to common Web3 security use cases.

Threat Intelligence Integration: Leverage Immunefiâ€™s CODEX to contextualize alerts and improve signal-to-noise ratio.

Smart Contract Awareness: Automatically map, classify, and track deployed contracts across networks.


Firewall Integration: Establish conditional control over onchain activity with programmable protection layers.

--Philosophy
Magnus is built on the principle that security should be as composable and decentralized as the applications it protects. Rather than enforce a rigid framework, Magnus offers customizable modules and APIs that integrate into existing developer workflows. This empowers teams to proactively shape their security posture without compromising on speed or control.

---Getting Started
To begin using Magnus, visit the official Immunefi website and request access to the platform. After onboarding, you can connect your smart contracts, configure your detection parameters, and begin deploying automated workflows immediately. Detailed documentation is available to assist with integration and customization.
