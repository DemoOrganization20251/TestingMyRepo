Magnus is a comtion platform developed by Immunefi. It provides protocols with the tools needed to consolidate and automate their security operations, combining multiple layers of defense into a single interface. Built with scalability and adaptability in mind, Magnus is engineered to meet the evolving security needs of decentralized systems.

Overview
In the rapidly shifting landscape of Web3, maintaining proactive and responsive security infrastructure is essential. Magnus bridges the gap between manual SecOps and the demand for rea are exploited, automate incident response procedures, and maintain visibility across all deployed smart contracts. It is designed to act not just as a monitoring system, but as a decision-making engine that integrates with both human and machine agents.

Firewall Integration: Establish conditional control over onchain activity with programmable protection layers.

--Philosophy
Magnus is built on the principle that security should be as composable and decentralized as the applications it protects. Rather than enforce a rigid framework, Magnus offers customizable modules and APIs that integrate into existing developer workflows. This empowers teams to proactively shape their security posture without compromising on speed or control.

Getting Started
